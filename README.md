Marketplace Technical Foundation - Day 2
Day 2 Goal
Transition from business-oriented planning to technical preparation for building the marketplace. The focus is on creating a high-level technical plan tailored to a General E-Commerce platform for lightweight daily-use women’s jewelry, including:
•	System architecture.
•	API requirements.
•	Technical workflows.
•	Integration with Sanity CMS and third-party APIs.
Recap of Day 1: Business Focus
Achievements:
1.	Business Goals Defined:
•	Problem-solving objectives.
•	Target audience: Women seeking lightweight, elegant, and affordable jewelry for daily use.
•	Unique value proposition (UVP): Affordable prices, high-quality products, and fast delivery.
2.	Data Schema Drafted:
•	Identified entities: Products, Orders, Customers, and their relationships.
3.	Focused Planning:
•	Established a strong foundation for technical implementation.





Day 2 Activities: Transitioning to Technical Planning
1. Define Technical Requirements
•	Frontend Requirements:
1)	User-friendly and responsive design for mobile and desktop.
2)	Essential pages: Home, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation.
•	Backend (Sanity CMS):
1)	Use Sanity CMS to manage product data, customer details, and orders.
2)	Design schemas aligned with jewelry business needs.
•	Third-Party APIs:
1)	Integrate APIs for payment gateways and shipment tracking.
2. Design System Architecture
•	Create a diagram showing interactions between components: 
2)	Frontend (Next.js): User interface.
3)	Sanity CMS: Manages products, orders, and customer details.
4)	Third-Party APIs: Payment gateway and shipment tracking.
Example Workflow:
1.	User browses jewelry products → Sanity CMS fetches product data → Displayed on frontend.
2.	User places an order → Order details saved in Sanity CMS.
3.	Shipment updates fetched via third-party API → Displayed to the user.
4.	Payment processed securely → Status updated in the system.
3. Plan API Requirements
•	Define endpoints based on workflows:
General E-Commerce Example:
•	/products (GET): Fetch all product details.
o	Response: { "id": 1, "name": "Earring A", "price": 500, "stock": 20 }
•	/orders (POST): Create a new order.
o	Payload: Customer info, product details, and payment status.
•	/shipment (GET): Track order status.
o	Response: { "shipmentId": 123, "status": "In Transit", "ETA": "2 days" }



4. Write Technical Documentation
•	Structure documentation into: 
1.	System Architecture Overview: 
	Diagram with component interactions.
2.	API Specification: 
	Endpoints, methods, payloads, and responses.
3.	Workflow Diagrams: 
	Visualize user interactions and data flow.
4.	Sanity Schemas: 
	Example: 
	export default {
	  name: 'product',
	  type: 'document',
	  fields: [
	    { name: 'name', type: 'string', title: 'Product Name' },
	    { name: 'price', type: 'number', title: 'Price' },
	    { name: 'stock', type: 'number', title: 'Stock Level' }
	  ]
	};
5. Collaborate and Refine
•	Peer Review: 
o	Share plans for feedback from teammates and mentors.
•	Version Control: 
o	Use GitHub for tracking changes and collaborating on diagrams or drafts.
